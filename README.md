# Salary Survey Template

In this project, we created a survey to collect information on people's salaries. We also worked with `app.py` and different web pages that link back to one another. On the "About" page, we included a photo of the project coders.

## To run this program, you will need:

4. **Create a new virtual environment**
   - Windows: `python -m venv ./venv`
   - Mac: `python3 -m venv ./venv`
5. **Activate the new virtual environment**
   - Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Mac: `source ./venv/bin/activate`
6. **Install the dependencies**
**Make a new repository by running git init in the folder**
8. **Track all the files in the new local repository**
9. **Make the first commit of this new project**
10. **On Github, create a new repository. DO NOT initialize it**
11. **Connect the local repository to the new Github repository**
 ```
 git remote add origin <<repository_URL>>
 ```
12. **Create and change to a new local development branch**
 ```
 git checkout -b development
 ```
13. **Continue working with the project as you normally would.**
